1. On each commit githook shall format your diffs with eslint and prettier. If you have it disabled for some reason, run manually.

2. Don't change things in PR that are unrelated to your PR, same isolation applies for commits.

3. Use Gitmoji with unicode chars if it does not slow you down.

4. Before opening a PR with changes that have not yet been discussed, consider opening an issue.
